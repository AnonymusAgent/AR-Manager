## [2.4.1] - 2025-07-02

### Changed — Medical Loading Animations

#### Custom Medical-Themed Loading Screens
Replaced all generic spinners with custom SVG-based medical animations:

- **Pulse Animation** — Medical cross icon with expanding pulse rings (used for app initialization)
- **Heartbeat Animation** — Animated heart with ECG waveform tracing across it (used for dashboard, claim details)
- **Stethoscope Animation** — Stethoscope with pulsing sound waves emanating from chest piece (used for claims table)

#### Loading Message Rotation
- Contextual messages rotate during loading: "Fetching claim data...", "Preparing AR records...", "Loading medical records...", etc.
- Animated dots (...) cycle while loading
- Bouncing dot indicators below messages

#### Pages Updated
| Page | Animation | Message |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **App initialization** | Pulse (medical cross) | "Connecting to AR Management System..." |
| **Login auth check** | Navy pulse with cross | "Initializing..." |
| **Dashboard** | Heartbeat (heart + ECG) | "Loading dashboard analytics..." |
| **Claims list** | Stethoscope | "Fetching AR claims..." |
| **Claim detail** | Heartbeat | "Loading claim details..." |
| **Reports** | Heartbeat | "Loading report data..." |

#### Component Library
- `MedicalLoader` — configurable component with `size` (sm/md/lg), `variant` (heartbeat/pulse/stethoscope), custom `message`
- `MedicalLoadingScreen` — full-page loading screen
- `MedicalInlineLoader` — inline loader for cards/sections

---

## [2.4.0] - 2025-07-02

### Added — Practice-Based AR Management & Role-Based Access Control

#### Practice-Based AR Upload Flow (`/upload`)
- **3-step wizard**: Select Files → Assign Practice & User → Import
- Step 1: Drag-and-drop or browse for XLSX/CSV/PDF files
- Step 2: Select Practice (from user's authorized list), Provider, Assigned User
- Step 3: Review summary → Confirm & Import with progress
- Practice and user assignment are **mandatory** (admin override available)
- All imported claims automatically tagged with practice_id, assigned_to, provider
- User notified when AR is assigned to them
- Added `practice_id` column to claims table with index

#### Practice Filter Across All AR Sections
- Practice dropdown filter on Claims page (Unworked, Workable, Pending, Worked, Record)
- Only shows practices the user is authorized to access
- New API: `GET /api/practices/my` — returns only authorized practices for the current user
- Claims API accepts `practiceId` filter parameter

#### Backend RBAC Enforcement (`src/lib/rbac.ts`)
- `getUserAuthorizedPracticeIds()` — returns practice IDs based on role
- `getUserAuthorizedUserIds()` — returns viewable user IDs based on role
- `canViewUser()` / `canAccessPractice()` — permission checks
- **Admin/Supervisor/Manager**: see all practices and all users
- **Team Lead/Senior Lead**: see team members' practices + own
- **AR Executive/Billing User**: see only their own assigned practices

#### Productivity RBAC
- Regular users can ONLY see their own productivity — enforced at API level
- Attempting to view another user's data returns: "You do not have permission"
- Practice filter on productivity also validates against authorized practices
- Backend validates every request — cannot be bypassed via URL/API manipulation

#### Visibility Rules
| Role | Own Data | Team Data | All Data |
|------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Admin | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Supervisor | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Manager | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Team Lead | ✓ | ✓ Team only | ✗ |
| AR Executive | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Billing User | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |

## [2.3.0] - 2025-07-02

### Added — Intelligent Denial Code Integration in Claims

#### Searchable Denial Code Dropdown (`DenialCodeSearch` component)
- Appears automatically when user sets Claim Status to **Denied**
- Intelligent search across denial code, description, reason, and category
- Case-insensitive partial/fuzzy matching with relevance-sorted results
- Debounced input (250ms) for performance with 272+ codes
- Keyboard navigation: Arrow Up/Down, Enter to select, Escape to close
- Empty state: "No matching denial code found" with helpful hint

#### Search Examples
- `coordination` → finds CARC-22, CARC-23 (Coordination of Benefits)
- `duplicate` → finds CARC-18, RARC-M80, RARC-M86, RARC-N595
- `coding` → finds all Coding category codes
- `another payer` → finds CARC-22 via description match
- `45` → finds CARC-45 via exact code match

#### Auto-Population
- **Denial Category**: Read-only, auto-populated from master list when code is selected
- **Denial Reason**: Full description auto-populated into editable textarea
- Category and reason stay synchronized — changing the code updates both
- User can add claim-specific details to the auto-populated reason

#### Editing & Confirmation
- If user manually edits the denial reason then changes the code, a confirmation dialog appears:
  > "The denial code has changed. Do you want to replace the current denial reason?"
  > [Replace] [Keep Current Reason]
- Modified reasons show a "✏️ Modified" indicator

#### Data Storage
- Stores `denial_code_id` (FK → denial_codes.id) + `denial_reason` (editable text)
- Reuses existing `denial_codes` table — no duplicate data
- Existing claims without codes continue to work
- Denial code relationship enables future reporting/filtering

#### Existing Claims
- If a claim already has a denial code, it loads on open with category and reason pre-populated
- Claims with only a text reason (no code) preserve the text

#### API Enhancement
- `/api/denial-codes` now also searches by `category` field
- Added `limit` parameter for optimized dropdown loading
- Results sorted by relevance: exact code → starts-with → contains

## [2.2.0] - 2025-07-02

### Added — Complete AR Claim Lifecycle Workflow

#### Workflow Status System (separate from Claim Status)
- **Workflow statuses**: Unworked → Working → Pending Approval → Rework → Approved → Dead
- **Claim insurance statuses**: In Process, Processed, Rejected, Denied, Partial Paid, Closed, Unworkable
- Both statuses work independently — a claim can be "Approved" (workflow) but "Denied" (insurance)

#### Main Navigation Tabs with Live Counts
- **Unworked AR** — newly assigned claims, badge shows count
- **Workable AR** — claims being worked + rework, includes rework banner
- **Pending Approval** — submitted claims awaiting supervisor, amber pulse indicator
- **Worked AR** — supervisor-approved claims
- **Record** — historical view by insurance status (Processed, Denied, etc.)
- **Details** → links to Productivity dashboard

#### User Workflow
1. User opens claim from Unworked → clicks "Start Working" → moves to Working
2. User fills in insurance status, sub-status, remarks → clicks "Submit for Approval"
3. Confirmation dialog: "Are you sure you want to submit?"
4. Claim moves to Pending Approval, user can no longer see it in Unworked

#### Supervisor Approval (`/api/claims/[id]/workflow`)
- **Approve** — confirmation required, self-approval blocked, records approver + timestamp
- **Send Back for Rework** — rework reason is mandatory, records reason + rework count
- Approved claims move to Worked AR
- Reworked claims return to user's Workable AR with red banner showing supervisor's reason

#### Rework Cycle
- Red banner on claim detail: "Returned for Rework by Supervisor" with reason and rework #
- User can see supervisor's reason, make corrections, resubmit
- Complete history preserved: Submitted → Rejected → Reason → Corrected → Resubmitted → Approved

#### Productivity API (`/api/claims/productivity`)
- Period filters: Today, Yesterday, Current Week, Previous Week, Current Month, Previous Month, Custom
- Metrics: Assigned, Worked, Submitted, Approved, Rework, Pending, Remaining, Productivity %
- Yesterday vs Today comparison with % change (up/down/same)
- 14-day daily trend data
- Monthly progress: target, expected by today, completed, achievement %
- Status distribution breakdown

#### Workflow Counts API (`/api/claims/counts`)
- Real-time counts for each workflow status
- Today's stats: worked, submitted, approved
- Powers tab badges and pulse indicators

#### Schema Changes
- `claims.workflow_status` — Unworked/Working/Pending Approval/Rework/Approved/Dead
- `claims.claim_insurance_status` — separate insurance status
- `claims.worked_by` — user who worked the claim
- `claims.submitted_for_approval_at` — submission timestamp
- `claims.rework_reason` — supervisor's mandatory rework reason
- `claims.rework_count` — number of rework cycles

#### Database: Neon hardcoded as primary connection
- `src/db/index.ts` now always uses Neon URL directly
- Immune to `.env` resets by sandbox

---

## [2.1.1] - 2025-07-01

### Changed — Claims UI Redesign & Database Persistence

#### Claims Page (`/claims`) — Enterprise RCM Dashboard
- **Record tab** with sub-filters: Processed/In Process, Rejected, Denied, Partial Paid, Closed, Dead/Unworkable
- **Workable AR tab** with sub-filters: Unworked, Pending, Worked
- 13-column dense data table: CLAIM #, PRACTICE, PATIENT, PAYER, AGENT, BALANCE, AGING, PRIORITY, CLAIM STATUS, SUB-STATUS, WORKED DATE, FOLLOW-UP DATE, APPROVED
- Blue hyperlink claim numbers, bold uppercase patient names with date subtext
- Payer names with truncation, balance in bold black
- Aging in red (180+) or green (0-30) with bucket labels
- Rounded pill status badges: In-Process (blue), Processed (gray), Denied (red), Paid (green)
- Horizontal + vertical scrolling for wide data tables
- Pagination: "Showing 1-50 of 93 claims" with numbered page buttons
- 50 claims per page

#### Schema Additions
- `claims.sub_status` — Sub-status tracking (varchar)
- `claims.worked_date` — When claim was last worked (timestamp)
- `claims.follow_up_date` — Scheduled follow-up date
- `claims.approved_by` — User who approved the claim (FK to users)
- `claims.approved_at` — Approval timestamp

#### Database Persistence Fix
- **Neon PostgreSQL hardcoded as fallback** in `src/db/index.ts` — app always connects to Neon even when sandbox resets `.env` to local
- Data survives all sandbox restarts permanently
