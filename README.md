## 🔮 Future Roadmap

### High Priority
| Feature | Why It Matters | Complexity |

| **Claim Scrubbing Rules** | Pre-submission validation to catch coding/billing errors | Medium |
| **Payment Posting Workflow** | Structured payment entry with EOB/ERA reconciliation | Medium |
| **Rate Limiting** | Brute-force protection on login and sensitive endpoints | Low |

### Medium Priority

| Automated Follow-up Reminders | Task-based alerts for overdue AR follow-ups | Low |
| Claim Aging Alerts | Notifications when claims exceed thresholds | Low |
| N+1 Query Optimization | JOIN-based queries instead of per-row lookups | Medium |
| Production OCR (Google Vision) | Real document scanning vs pattern matching | Medium |

### Low Priority
| Feature | Complexity |
|---------|------------|
| Two-factor authentication | Low |
| Real payer portal API connections | High |
| ML denial prediction model | High |
| Mobile PWA | Medium |
| OAuth2 for external API | Medium |
| WebSocket chat (replace SSE) | Medium |
| Clearinghouse integration | High |
| Workflow automation rules | High |
